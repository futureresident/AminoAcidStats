This is a visualization of the proportion of codons that code for the same codons, as well as the frequency of each base in the codons.

As a Computer Science course assignment, I was given a choice of picking my own data set and performing meaningful visualizations on it. 
Given my background in Biology, I decided to go with the list of codons and the proteins they code for. 

The first visualization is the proportion of codons that code for the same protein (out of a total of 64). 
The second is the frequency of each base in the codons. 

matplotlib was used to plot the data set on pie charts.
